    <description>

      <p>pam-dotfile-gen is a utility to create a password for a
	  particular service, if your system administrator has set up
	  authenication for that service with libpam-dotfile.</p>

      <p>To create or change your password, just enter pam-dotfile-gen
      -a &lt;service&gt; and you will be prompted for the
      password. The password will be written to ~/.pam-&lt;service&gt;
      in a hashed format. To add another password to the same service
      repeat the command.</p>

      <p>If called without any argument the tool will act as
      filter. Unencrypted passwords are read from STDIN, are crypted
      and written to STDOUT. The passwords are separated by
      newlines. Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored and
      written in an untouched way to STDOUT.</p>

      <p>The file format of the ~/.pam is rather simple. Every
      non-empty line which does not begin with # is compared with the
      hashed password to be checked. This allows you to specify free
      form comments for each password with a simple text editor.</p>
