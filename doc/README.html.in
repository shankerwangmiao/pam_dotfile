href="http://www.stud.uni-hamburg.de/~lennart/projects/pam_dotfile/pam_dotfile-0.5.tar.gz">Version
0.5</a> released, changes include: Autoconf support, fixed an important bug regarding a race on child process creation. <b>All users should update.</b></p>

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p><tt>pam_dotfile</tt>is a PAM module which allows users to have more
than one password for a single account, each for a different
service. This is desirable because many users have objections to using
the same password for (as an example) an IMAP4 mailbox and SSH
access. The IMAP4 password should be distinct from the SSH password
because the user wants to save the former in the configuration of his
mail agent, but not the latter. The same applies to POP3 mailboxes,
FTP and comparable services.</p>

<h2><a name="status">Status</a></h2>

<p>Version @PACKAGE_VERSION@ is stable and feature complete.</p>
  
<h2><a name="documentation">Documentation</a></h2>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The module needs be activated for the specific service in the
configuration file <tt>/etc/pam.d/&lt;service&gt;</tt>. The user is
than able to create a second valid password for that service by
issuing the following commands:</p>

<pre>
pam-dotfile-gen -a &lt;service&gt;
</pre>

<p>Replace <tt>&lt;service&gt;</tt> by the PAM service name, e.g. <tt>imapd</tt>. The user has to enter the new password twice. This will save the
password to <tt>~/.pam-&lt;service&gt;</tt> in a hashed way.</p>

<p>A complete example for the service <tt>imap</tt> (for the IMAP server dovecot in this
case):</p>

<p><tt>/etc/pam.d/imap</tt>:</p>

<pre>
#%PAM-1.0
auth sufficient pam_unix_auth.so
auth sufficient pam_dotfile.so use_first_pass no_warn
auth required pam_deny.so
</pre>

<p>As user <tt>waldo</tt>:</p>

<pre>
[waldo@wonder] ~$ pam-dotfile-gen -a imap
Password:quux
Please repeat; password:quux
Password added.
</pre>

<p>That's it. User <tt>waldo</tt> may now access his IMAP mail store either by
using his unix password or by using <i>quux</i>.</p>

<p>If you want to deny access with the unix password when a <tt>.pam</tt> file
exists, you should install the following <tt>/etc/pam.d/imap</tt>:</p>

<pre>
#%PAM-1.0
auth [success=done new_authtok_reqd=done authinfo_unavail=ignore default=die] pam_dotfile.so no_warn
auth [success=done new_authtok_reqd=done default=die] pam_unix.so use_first_pass
</pre>

<p>Please note: the <tt>pam.d</tt> fragments shown above are based on Debian
GNU/Linux' default PAM installation. I know that some distributions
(i.e. Red Hat) use <tt>pam_pwdb.so</tt> instead of <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> as default
authentication mechanism. Please adapt the <tt>pam.d</tt> configuration to your
specific distribution.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>For getting access to the user's files a SUID root helper utility
<tt>/sbin/pam-dotfile-helper</tt> is used.</p>

<p>The <tt>.pam</tt> files are ignored when their access mode AND 077 is non-zero,
when they are symlinks or when any parent directory is group or world
writable.</p>

<p><tt>pam_dotfile</tt> will try to open the the following files for
authentication (in that order):</p>

<ol>
  <li><tt>~/.pam-&lt;service&gt;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>~/.pam/&lt;service&gt;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>~/.pam-other</tt></li>
  <li><tt>~/.pam/other</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>The first file in this list that exists is used for
authentication. Regardless of any of the passwords contained therein
are correct the other files are NOT evaluated.</p>

<p>The hashing is implemented in the following way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A 16 byte random string is read from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> (salt)</li>
  <li>It is formatted in a 32 character hexadecimal string</li>
  <li>The password is appended</li>
  <li>The MD5 hash of this string is calculated</li>
  <li>The hash is formatted in another 32 character hexadecimal string</li>
  <li>The result is the concatenation of the two hexadecimal strings</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe that this is somewhat secure. However, I am not a
cryptoanalyst, I cannot guarantee for this. (Probably a cryptoanalyst
cannot either.)</p>

<p>The hashing function changed a little from 0.5 to 0.6. There was an
ugly error in formatting the digest into a hexadecimal string. By fixing
this the old hashed passwords became incompatible with newer releases
of <tt>pam_dotfile</tt>. For sake of compatibility I added the option
<tt>--enable-compat05</tt> to the <tt>configure</tt> script. Passwords
for 0.6 are prefixed with a <tt>+</tt> in the dot files, older
passwords are not. You are encouraged to fix your passwords to comply
with the new version.</p>

<p><tt>pam-dotfile-gen</tt> may be used as a filter that reads a text stream
with unencrypted passwords and crypts them. Empty lines and those
starting with # are passed in an unmodified way to STDOUT. Thus the
user may comment the passwords in his <tt>.pam</tt> files.</p>

<h3>PAM parameters</h3>

<ul>
  
  <li><tt>debug</tt> - Be very verbose to <tt>syslog(3)</tt></li>
  
  <li><tt>use_first_pass</tt> - Don't issue a password prompt, use one
  supplied by a previous modules</li>

  <li><tt>try_first_pass</tt> - Nearly the same as <tt>use_first_pass</tt>, but don't
  fail if no password was supplied, instead query the user</li>
  
  <li><tt>use_authtok</tt> - Synonym for <tt>use_first_pass</tt></li>
  
  <li><tt>rootok</tt> - Don't deny access for users with <tt>uid == 0</tt></li>
  
  <li><tt>nullok</tt> - Don't deny access for null passwords</li>
  
  <li><tt>fork</tt> - Always fork before trying to open the password files via the helper tool</li>
  
  <li><tt>nofork</tt> - Never fork</li>
  
  <li><tt>no_warn</tt> - Suppress warnings to <tt>syslog(3)</tt></li>
  
  <li><tt>stat_only_home</tt> - verifies group/world readability only inside the home directory.
  e.g. if the configuration file is <tt>/home/waldo/.pam/service</tt>
  only <tt>/home/waldo/.pam</tt> and <tt>/home/waldo</tt> are tested.
  This is sometimes necessary if the home directories are symbolic links.</li>

  <li><tt>nocompat05</tt> - Disable compatibility with <tt>pam_dotfile</tt> <= 0.5. This is only available if <tt>pam_dotfile</tt> was compiled with <tt>--enable-compat05</tt></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<p><tt>pam_dotfile</tt> was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux
"testing" from July 2003, it should work on most other Linux
distributions (and maybe Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf and
GNU libtool for source code configuration and shared library
management.</p>

<p>You need the PAM development headers installed (naturally...)</p>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
<tt>./configure</tt> inside the distribution directory for configuring
the source tree. After that you should run <tt>make</tt> for
compilation and <tt>make install</tt> (as root) for installation of
<tt>pam_dotfile</tt>.</p>

<p>If you upgrade from versions prior to 0.6 you should pass
<tt>--enable-compat05</tt> to <tt>configure</tt> to enable
compatibility with old user dot files. If you do not specify this, old
passwords are ignored, the users have to recreate their passwords with
<tt>pam-dotfile-gen</tt>.</p>

<p>If you do a fresh install you should not pass
<tt>--enable-compat05</tt> to <tt>configure</tt>. (An alternative is
to specify <tt>--enable-compat05</tt> but to disable it afterwards by
using <tt>nocompat05</tt> on the pam configuration line.)</p>
